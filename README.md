<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About T2Chat

<img width="100%" alt="chat-interface" src="./public/T2Chat.jpg">

# AI chat infrastructure for absolutely everyone

The open source ChatGPT alternative. You are in charge of your own data, conversations, and AI models.

ChatGPT and other AI chat tools are incredible. They've revolutionized how we interact with AI. We use them for work, learning, creative projects, and problem-solving. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control, customization, and data ownership.

That's where T2Chat comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. Multi-model by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your conversations and data.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run T2Chat.

- Node.js (Version: >=18.x)
- npm/yarn/pnpm _(npm is used here might switch to pnpm)_

> If you want to enable any of the available AI integrations, you may want to obtain API keys for each provider. More details can be found below under the [AI Providers section](#ai-providers).

## Development

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nyaughh/t2chat.git
   cd t2chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   # Convex
   CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-convex-deployment-url (eg: dev:blue-bird-144)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your-convex-url (eg: https://blue-bird-144.convex.cloud)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL=your-convex-site-url (eg: https://blue-bird-144.convex.site)

   # Better Auth
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret
   BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

   # UploadThing
   UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your-uploadthing-secret
   UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=your-uploadthing-app-id

   # AI Providers
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-google-ai-key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key
   ```

4. **Set up Convex**

   ```sh
   npx convex dev
   ```

   This will:

   - Create a new Convex project (if needed) or use an existing one

   Whille it syncs: 

   1. Navigate to your [convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/)
   2. Select the "dev" environment of your project and go to the "Environmental Variables" tab in Settings
   3. Add the following variables:
      ```
      BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
      BETTER_AUTH_URL

      GITHUB_CLIENT_ID (for github auth)
      GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET

      OPENAI_API_KEY
      GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
      GROQ_API_KEY

      TAVILY_API_KEY (for web search tool)
      ```

5. **Start the development server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Make sure `npx convex dev` is running in the background.

6. **Open your browser**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


<!-- DEPLOYMENT -->

## Deployment


### Set up your Convex Production Environment (Required)

Go to your [convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) and select the "prod" environment of your project. 

Paste the same variables and make sure `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is set to your production domain.


### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercl.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/nyaughh/t2chat)
